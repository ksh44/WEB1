<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
  where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
  Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
  hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of
  the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
  may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser
  and are published by a software application called a web server.
  The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed
  the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies
  the Web is built.</p>
